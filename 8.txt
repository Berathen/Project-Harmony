Your achievements are heard by the King of this country and you are invited to his court. When you arrive the steward told you to meet with the King at a different room. When you enter you can hear that they are arguing over something. The King looks at you with a tired look. "Finally you are here. Good Lords let the national hero choose the method of the war. Defense or offense?" Yes they were talking about the coming war. To choose is your job. Defense or offense?
